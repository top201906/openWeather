*HttpRunner* is a simple & elegant, yet powerful HTTP(S) testing framework. Enjoy! ✨ 🚀 ✨

## Design Philosophy

- Embrace open source, stand on giants' shoulders, like [`Requests`][Requests], [`unittest`][unittest] and [`Locust`][Locust].
- Convention over configuration.
- Pursuit of high rewards, write once and achieve a variety of testing needs

## Key Features

- Inherit all powerful features of [`Requests`][Requests], just have fun to handle HTTP(S) in human way.
- Define testcases in YAML or JSON format in concise and elegant manner.
- Record and generate testcases with [`HAR`][HAR] support. see [`har2case`][har2case].
- Supports `variables`/`extract`/`validate` mechanisms to create full test scenarios.
- Supports perfect hook mechanism.
- With `debugtalk.py` plugin, very easy to implement complex logic in testcase.
- Testcases can be run in diverse ways, with single testcase, multiple testcases, or entire project folder.
- Test report is concise and clear, with detailed log records.
- With reuse of [`Locust`][Locust], you can run performance test without extra work.
- CLI command supported, perfect combination with `CI/CD`.

## Documentation

HttpRunner is rich documented.

- [`中文用户使用手册`][user-docs-zh]
- [`开发历程记录博客`][development-blogs]
